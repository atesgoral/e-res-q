# E-Res-Q

E-Res-Q (read "ee rescue") is a very simple, portable POP3 mail reader. It enables you to selectively read and delete messages without having to download them all (it just reads the headers). Ideal for getting rid of large messages that clog up your mailbox or getting rid of spam messages.

This small program has proved very useful back in the times when most of us still had dial-up connections. It's still a very useful utility for setting up quick access to your POP3 mailbox when you're temporarily using someone else's computer. The fact that it doesn't require installation is a plus. You just download the zip file, extract the binary and run it, punch in your account settings and you're good to go!
